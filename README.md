# Covid-19-Analysis

**Analysis of Covid related data from India and Italy**

In this coding project we are doing analysis of covid data from India and Italy. The goal is to understand various relationships between data for total hospitalizations, deaths, recovered patients, patients testing positive, total samples and so on.

This code is written in python and uses libraries like numpy, seaborn, matplotlib and panda.
The dataset is from Kaggle and has been formatted.

Using the available dataset, we can visualize and understand the trends. Based on these trends the government, medical community and experts can make critical decisions to keep the general population safe. They will also be able to determine if various measures like lockdown, mask wearing, and social distancing are leading to positive trends.

The analysis should also show if some areas in the country are more affected than others.

Using pairplot method, we can see the pairwise relationship in the dataset. The image below shows the possible combinations with the data set from Italy.

The graph below shows that the death rate in the state of Maharashtra is much higher compared to other states. However, the graph also shows that more people are recovering from the disease.

The graph below shows that number of recovered cases in Italy are also increasing as the cases are rising. So, that is promising.

The second graph shows that the total hospitalization curve is bending even though the cases continue to rise. This graph also shows that cases in the Molise region are rising at a much higher rate compared to other regions in Italy.

The graphs below show that the home confinements curve is also bending in comparison to the total positive cases. The graph also shows that people in Molise region have more people in quarantine in comparison to other regions. 

The deaths are also rising at a rapid speed with increase in total positive cases. Morbidity is very high in the Molise region in comparison to other regions.
